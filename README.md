# github-user-repo-search-demo

Simple React App to demonstrate my coding style & file structure for the following stack:

Javascript (ES6/7)
react
redux
immutableJS
jest
ava
webpack
babel
eslint

The app allows to input a username and to fetch a list of the user's Github repositories.
It includes a webpack-dev-server.
Run the app (localhost:3000) --> "npm start" 
Run tests (ava & jest) --> "npm test"
Redux DevTools can be opened with CTRL-H in the browser.
