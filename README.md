# github-user-repo-search-demo

Simple React App to demonstrate my coding style & file structure for the following stack:

- Javascript (ES6/7)
- react
- redux
- immutableJS
- jest
- ava
- webpack
- babel
- eslint

The app allows to input a username and to fetch a list of the user's Github repositories.

It includes a webpack-dev-server.
- Run the app (localhost:3000) --> "npm start"
- Run tests (ava & jest) --> "npm test"

Redux DevTools can be opened with CTRL-H in the browser.
